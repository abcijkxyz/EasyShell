The current directory of the opened shell is the directory which was selected with the popup menu. Additionally it is possible to run selected file in the shell and copy file or directory path.\r\nMultiple selections are also supported.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n-------------\r\nUse update site: http://anbos.de/eclipse/pluginbox-updatesite/\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n[Download ZIP file](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pluginbox/files/latest/download), extract it to \"eclipse\\dropin\" folder and restart.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------\r\n\r\nEasyShell does not support virtual folders, because they are not\r\npresent in the file system!\r\n\r\nThe plugin is platform-independent in principal. It just launches\r\na (configurable) system command to open the shell. The following\r\nplatform and shell combinations are supported as selections\r\navailable from the drop-down-list in the preferences page:\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n- DOS-Shell / Explorer\r\n- PowerShell / Explorer (check path of PowerShell executable!)\r\n- Cygwin (Bash) / Explorer (check path of Cygwin-bash executable!)\r\n  http://cygwin.com\r\n- Console / Explorer\r\n  https://sourceforge.net/projects/console\r\n- DOS-Shell / TotalCommander\r\n  http://www.ghisler.com\r\n- Git (Bash) / Explorer (check path of Git-bash executable!)\r\n  http://msysgit.github.io\r\n- ConEmu / Explorer (check path of ConEmu executable!)\r\n  https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/\r\n\r\nUnix / Linux:\r\n- KDE Konsole / Konqueror and Dolphin\r\n- Gnome Terminal / Nautilus\r\n- MAC OS X Terminal / Finder\r\n- CDE Xterm / Dtfile (not tested!)\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n- Default / Unknown (can be defined for all systems supported by Java)\r\n\r\nBut you can configure any shell or command you like as long as you\r\ncan figure out how to run a command to open the shell with given\r\nparameters. The following substitution variables are available\r\nfor building the command:\r\n\r\n{0} = The drive letter (only Windows, not used on other platforms)<br/>\r\n{1} = The selected directory path<br/>\r\n{2} = The selected file or directory path<br/>\r\n{3} = The selected file name<br/>\r\n{4} = The project name of selected directory or path (for external files it's \"Easy Shell\")<br/>\r\n{5} = The line separator<br/>\r\n\r\nOption \"Enable string tokenizer\" with values \"Yes, No\" and default value \"Yes\".<br/>\r\nThe whole command line string will be splitted (tokenized) to single strings before expansion\r\nof parameters {0} - {4} and passing to command line. With this solution there is no need to\r\nsurround parameters {0} - {4} with quotes when space character is possible between command\r\nline option and parameter, e.g.: /D {1}. Otherwise maybe quotes are still needed,\r\ne.g.: --working-directory=\"{1}\".\r\n\r\nOption \"Add quotes to {1}, {2}, {3}*\" with values \"No, Single, Double, Automatic\" and default\r\nvalue \"No\". <br/>\r\nIf changed to other values, parameters will be eclosed with quotes.\r\nATTENTION: use it carefully with \"string tokenizer\" and remove quotes from commands.\r\n\r\nOption \"Enable debug output\" with values \"Yes, No\" and default value \"No\".<br/>\r\nIf changed to \"Yes\", debug messages will be printed to error console.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
